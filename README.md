## Choosen styling - Styled Components

I choose to use style components as prefered way of styling since i find it similar to the component based mindset that react has.
Though I would consider to explore tailwind further since I think it can be more effective if I would define variants that could be reusable.

### The technologies I used

#### axios -

To create api request to server to fetch/post/patch/delete data.

#### concurrently

To be able to run both backend & frontend simultaneously.

#### json-server

To store data

#### match-sorter

To match & sort data from arrays more efficent and accurately

#### react-calendar

To get a functional calendar from react library

#### react icons

To get menu icons and other informational elements for the app.

#### StyledComponents

To style appplication.
